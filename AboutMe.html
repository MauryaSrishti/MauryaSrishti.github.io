            <p style="margin: auto 0">
                I am also a medalist in the 5 km running marathon and 10km Cycling marathon. I love Coding as it gives me a 
                feeling of creating something, which is what I love the most in the world.

            <h2>Coding and Me</h2>
            <p style="margin: auto 0;">
                I was way too far from coding that I hadn't even heard of it until 2<sup>nd</sup> grade when I got used to seeing sister coding on the computer and 
                creating creative programs. I was so fascinated to see such complexity and hard work behind such simple looking machine which, I thought was just a box 
                of metals. I wrote my first code Hello World when I was in grade 6 and, this was the beginning of a very long journey. I started creating actual 
                programs in class 8. It was LangVoyager. Since then, I have made other programs like Flap n' Gap and have been working on Accordians.
