                about me. It cover from every basics to the details of the the biggest events in my life. I am feeling very

            <h2>My first Javasript program</h2>
            <p>
                I ceated my first Javascript game Flap n' Gap a recreation or say Flappy Bird itself. It made my leisure 
                time more fun and productive, as I learnt a new sskill as well as I got a good game to play in my leisure time.
                It was very good experience of building a personal game. Very nicely explained by LearrnWD from where I learn to code
                this game and veery kind for giving all the resources.

            <h2>I enter the world of Javascript</h2>
            <p>
                Jun 04 2021,<br>
                I entered the world of Javascript on Jun 04. A very simple to learn, understand and <code>code</code>.
                I understood the basics. A very simple language Javascript is. The best part is that now maybe I will 
                be able to import APIs of different ports and make my website more attractive. The language defines both simplicity 
                and power. the canvas was te best of them all. Amazing!
